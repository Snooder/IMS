# IMS
Inventory Management System using Node.js
Project first began August 14th, 2020

Inspiration: A friend had told me that a client was interested in turning her Property Management into a mobile format in the form of an app or website. To prepare
myself for a possible contract, I started to learn how to interact with a JS framework using a Node.JS server to pull housing and inventory data from a database
system and then prepare that data to be seen on a mobile device.

IMS was made to test the capabilities of NativeScript. This javascript framework is an incredibly durable technology that is able to generate an
an app framework on either iOS or Android using the same Javascript/Typescript code.

This project works in 3 parts.

Nativescript: Which provided the framework for which the JS and Typescript files would physically display on the respective device we are running on.

Node.JS Server: Which acted as the API that would pull the important data from the respetive database management server and also provided the data back through
HTTPS endpoints.

MongoDB: Which held the sample property location data as well as a variety of sample furniture data in JSON format.
